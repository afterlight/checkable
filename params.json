Let's say you want to change all the checkboxes on your site that are inside a form with the id \"mainForm\":\r\n\r\n`\r\n    $(\"#mainForm\").checkable();\r\n`\r\n\r\nThat's it. You're done with the JavaScript, you can now worry about making your checkboxes look good!\r\n\r\nThe script will wrap a label with a class of `.checkable-field` around the checkbox, additionally `.checkable-radio` and `.checkable-checkbox` will be added to radio buttons and checkboxes respectively.\r\n\r\n[Check out the demo](http://jvdl.com.au/demos/checkable/)."}
